# **Natural Language Processing with Hugging Face**

In this project, I perform common Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using Hugging Face. The main tasks include:

- Sentiment Analysis: Categorizing text as negative or positive.

- Text Embedding: Transforming a piece of text into a numerical, n-dimensional vector representation.

- Semantic Search: Matching a query with the most appropriate result based on embeddings.
